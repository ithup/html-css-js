        In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me <br>
        some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.<br>

        'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, '<br>
        just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the <br>
        advantages that you've had.'
